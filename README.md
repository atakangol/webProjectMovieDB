# Movie Database - Web Project

The aim of our project is to build a website where people can find movie recommendations based on their favourite actor/director/category, so the Topic will be Movie recommendation.
We’ll use themoviedb API that contains a movie database with Entities such as Movies, People(Actors/directors), Genres etc.
